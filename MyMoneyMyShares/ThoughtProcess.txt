This file is for me like what's going in my mind, points to remember for me.

Imp points
1. Apples cannot be cut.
2. The distribution should be as fair as possible.
3. Read apple weights until a negative value is entered.

Thought process
1. It's a problem of simple maths. 

2. I just have to calculate the total grams of apples and then 
    the percentage shares of each individual
    then get the proportionate of each person shares.

3. Then find out the weight of apples in the list and print them.
