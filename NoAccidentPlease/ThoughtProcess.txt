This file is for me like what's going in my mind, points to remember for me.

Imp points
1. Only 3 different set of coordinates per Flight (The coordinates are the airport coordinates)
2. There can be many flights
3. All start from same place and time


Thought process
1. Maybe by looking at the code of previous flight agencies can help me to solve the problem. (But Let's use it if I don't find the solution)

2. (While Drawing) Got it, the flights can not jump directly from one coordinate to another, it can go to (take) different coordinates but end up at its final coordinate(Airport)

3. So I've to print all those coordinates which that flight took to reach the airports.

4. Ok, understood the problem. Now the thing is how would I know if the flights are colliding or not.
    Steps to solve the problem
    a. See if the path is colliding or not
    b. if Yes, then which other path to take?
        - if No, then simply print that coordinates
