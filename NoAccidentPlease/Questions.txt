This file is of no use just for the asking questions. 


1. What is the expected output format for the flight paths? Should it be a list of coordinates, a visual representation, or something else?

2. By looking at the problem, `Draw the path of all flights?`, I'm assuming to give coordinates as output

3. Can 2 or more than stop at the same airport?

4. Are there any specific constraints on the number of flights (N), the range of coordinates, or the desired distance between flight paths?

5. Can I assume that the given coordinates are valid and distinct?

6. Are there any specific edge cases or scenarios that I should consider?
