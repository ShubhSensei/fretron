This file is for me like what's going in my mind, points to remember for me.


According to the given question, I think

1. We first need to find all possible paths for a 'special castle' on a chessboard filled with 'soldiers', given the castle's specific movement rules.

2. The castle can only move forward, turn left after killing a soldier, and jump over soldiers.

3. Draw a sample chessboard with soldiers and try to manually find possible paths for the castle.

Points remember (isko pehle dekh lee)
a. A matrix or a dictionary could be suitable.


Potential Challenges
- Handling edge cases (reaching the board's edge, no possible moves).
- Ensuring correct movement and killing logic.
- Optimizing the pathfinding algorithm for large boards.
- Clearly representing the found paths.
